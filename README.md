DrivenData project (Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table)

This is my submission for the competition hosted by DrivenData (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/25/).
I have implemented used scikit-learn and keras to implement three different machine learning models for classification:
1) GradientBoost
2) RandomForest
3) NeuralNet

Finally, I have combined the three models into a single ensemble model. 

Unsurprisingly, validation results indicate that the ensemble method outperforms any individual model. As a result, I make my final predictions using the ensemble model.
